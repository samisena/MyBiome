# Implementation Complete: Vitamin D Problem Solved

## Summary

Successfully implemented LLM-based semantic duplicate detection and consensus wording selection to solve the "vitamin D problem" in the batch_medical_rotation pipeline.

## Problem

When processing papers with dual LLM extraction (gemma2:9b + qwen2.5:14b), the same finding would be counted twice with slightly different condition names:

- Paper 41031311 by gemma2:9b: "vitamin D for cognitive impairment"
- Paper 41031311 by qwen2.5:14b: "vitamin D for type 2 diabetes mellitus-induced cognitive impairment"

This created statistical inflation - one paper's finding counted as two separate pieces of evidence.

## Solution Implemented

### Phase 1: Two-Stage Duplicate Detection

**Location**: `back_end/src/llm_processing/entity_operations.py` (DuplicateDetector class)

Added `_stage2_llm_semantic_matching()` method that:
1. Groups interventions by intervention name
2. Uses LLM (qwen2.5:14b) to check if different condition names are semantically equivalent
3. Uses confidence threshold of 0.7 for equivalence
4. Builds connected components using graph-based grouping for transitive equivalence
5. Returns groups of semantically equivalent interventions

### Phase 2: Consensus Wording Selection

**Location**: `back_end/src/llm_processing/entity_operations.py` (DuplicateDetector class)

Enhanced `merge_duplicate_group()` method to:
1. Detect when duplicates have multiple condition wordings
2. Call LLM to select the best wording based on medical accuracy, clarity, and specificity
3. Store consensus metadata:
   - `condition_wording_source`: 'llm_consensus' or 'highest_confidence_fallback'
   - `condition_wording_confidence`: LLM confidence score (0.0-1.0)
   - `original_condition_wordings`: JSON array of all original wordings

### Phase 3: LLM Prompt Infrastructure

**Location**: `back_end/src/llm_processing/prompt_service.py`

Added two new prompt methods:

1. `create_condition_equivalence_prompt()`:
   - Checks if two condition names are semantically equivalent
   - Emphasizes medical safety (hypertension ≠ hypotension)
   - Considers hierarchical conditions in same-paper context
   - Returns: are_equivalent, confidence, reasoning, preferred_wording

2. `create_consensus_wording_prompt()`:
   - Selects best wording from multiple variants
   - Prioritizes medical accuracy, clarity, specificity
   - Returns: selected_wording, variant_number, confidence, reasoning

### Phase 4: LLM Processing Infrastructure

**Location**: `back_end/src/llm_processing/entity_operations.py` (LLMProcessor class)

Added three new methods:

1. `check_condition_equivalence()`:
   - Main method with bidirectional caching
   - Uses qwen2.5:14b for semantic reasoning
   - Returns equivalence analysis with confidence

2. `get_consensus_wording()`:
   - Selects consensus wording from variants
   - Uses LLM with temperature 0.1 for consistency
   - Returns selected wording with metadata

3. Supporting cache methods:
   - `_get_cached_condition_equivalence()`
   - `_cache_condition_equivalence()`
   - `_create_equivalence_cache_key()` - bidirectional cache keys

### Phase 5: Database Schema Updates

**Location**: `back_end/src/data_collection/database_manager.py`

Added three new columns to interventions table:
- `condition_wording_source TEXT`
- `condition_wording_confidence REAL CHECK(condition_wording_confidence >= 0 AND condition_wording_confidence <= 1)`
- `original_condition_wordings TEXT` (JSON array)

### Phase 6: Integration

**Location**: `back_end/src/llm_processing/batch_entity_processor.py`

Connected llm_processor to repository:
```python
self.repository.llm_processor = self.llm_processor
```

This allows DuplicateDetector to access LLM capabilities.

## Test Results

### Unit Test (test_vitamin_d_deduplication.py)

**Result**: PASS

- Stage 1 detected canonical name match
- Stage 2 would verify with LLM if needed
- Merge created consensus wording with 0.95 confidence
- Both models credited: "gemma2:9b,qwen2.5:14b"
- Selected more specific wording: "type 2 diabetes mellitus-induced cognitive impairment"

### Integration Test (test_complete_pipeline.py)

**Result**: PASS - All checks passed

- Successfully reduced 2 interventions to 1
- Both models credited in merged record
- Consensus wording metadata stored correctly
- Original wordings preserved in JSON format
- Database successfully stores all new fields

## Key Features

### Medical Safety
- Prevents matching opposite conditions (hypertension ≠ hypotension)
- Conservative with 0.7 confidence threshold
- When in doubt, prefers no match rather than incorrect match

### Performance Optimization
- Bidirectional caching prevents redundant LLM calls
- Stage 1 (exact matching) handles most cases without LLM
- Stage 2 (LLM semantic) only runs when needed

### Transparency
- Preserves original wordings from all models
- Records which model extracted what
- Stores confidence scores for auditability
- Documents consensus source (LLM vs fallback)

### Robustness
- Graceful fallback if LLM unavailable
- Graph-based grouping handles transitive equivalence
- Works with any number of models (not just dual)

## Files Modified

## Next Steps for Production Use

1. **Run batch_medical_rotation.py**: The complete pipeline should now:
   - Collect papers from PubMed
   - Extract with dual models (gemma2:9b + qwen2.5:14b)
   - Detect and merge same-paper duplicates with LLM verification
   - Store merged records with consensus wording metadata

2. **Monitor LLM Cache**: Check cache hit rate in logs to verify performance optimization

3. **Review Merged Records**: Query database for records with `condition_wording_source = 'llm_consensus'` to see LLM decisions

4. **Prompt Tuning (Optional)**: If LLM is too conservative or too aggressive in matching, adjust confidence threshold or prompt wording

## SQL Queries for Verification

### Count interventions with consensus wording
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM interventions
WHERE condition_wording_source = 'llm_consensus';
```

### View consensus wording examples
```sql
SELECT
    intervention_name,
    health_condition,
    models_used,
    condition_wording_confidence,
    original_condition_wordings
FROM interventions
WHERE condition_wording_source = 'llm_consensus'
LIMIT 10;
```

### Verify deduplication effectiveness
```sql
SELECT
    paper_id,
    COUNT(*) as intervention_count
FROM interventions
GROUP BY paper_id
HAVING intervention_count > 1;
```

This should show very few papers with multiple interventions for the same intervention-condition pair.

- ✅ LLM selects consensus wording with high confidence
- ✅ Both models credited in merged records
