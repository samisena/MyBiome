SUCCESS CHECK ACHIEVED: All existing records can now be normalized through batch process!

BATCH MIGRATION COMPONENTS COMPLETED:

1. [DONE] Pre-Migration Database Backup System
   - Created intervention_research_pre_migration_backup_20250925_192603.db
   - Automatic backup creation before any migration
   - Migration-specific backups for each run
   - Rollback capability with backup restoration

2. [DONE] Comprehensive Batch Migration Script (batch_migration_normalization.py)
   - Processes records in configurable batches (default: 100)
   - Progress logging and detailed statistics
   - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Off-hours optimization ready
   - Performance monitoring with batch timing
   - Command line options for flexible operation

3. [DONE] Database Schema Enhancement
   - Added intervention_canonical_id column
   - Added condition_canonical_id column
   - Added normalized BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE flag
   - Created canonical_entities and entity_mappings tables
   - Proper foreign key relationships and indexes

4. [DONE] Rollback Plan Implementation
   - Multiple backup layers (pre-migration, per-run)
   - Rollback command: --rollback backup_file_path
   - Current state preservation during rollback
   - Safe restoration from any backup point

5. [DONE] Migration Process Features
   - Batch processing: 100 records per batch by default
   - Progress tracking with percentage completion
   - Comprehensive logging to data/logs/
   - Statistics export to JSON format
   - Error collection and reporting
   - Performance metrics (records/second, batch timing)

BATCH MIGRATION WORKFLOW:

1. Pre-Migration:
   - Create database backup automatically
   - Verify database schema and tables
   - Initialize entity normalizer system
   - Setup logging and statistics collection

2. Batch Processing:
   - Query records WHERE normalized IS NULL OR normalized = 0
   - Process in batches of 100 records
   - For each record:
     a) Call find_or_create_mapping for intervention_name
     b) Call find_or_create_mapping for health_condition
     c) Update record with canonical IDs
     d) Set normalized = true
   - Commit batch transactions
   - Log progress and performance metrics

3. Post-Migration:
   - Verify migration completeness
   - Generate detailed statistics report
   - Log final results and performance
   - Success check: All records have canonical mappings

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:

# Process all records in production
python batch_migration_normalization.py

# Test with limited batches
python batch_migration_normalization.py --max-batches 5

# Custom batch size for performance tuning
python batch_migration_normalization.py --batch-size 50

# Verify current state without migration
python batch_migration_normalization.py --verify-only

# Rollback to previous state
python batch_migration_normalization.py --rollback backup_file.db

PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT FEATURES:

[READY] Off-Hours Operation: Script designed for overnight runs
[READY] Performance Monitoring: Batch timing and throughput metrics
[READY] Error Recovery: Continues processing despite individual failures
[READY] Progress Reporting: Detailed logging every 10 batches
[READY] Memory Optimization: Batch processing prevents memory issues
[READY] Database Safety: Multiple backup layers and rollback capability
[READY] Verification System: Post-migration completeness checking
[READY] Statistics Export: JSON reports for analysis and monitoring

MIGRATION STATISTICS TRACKING:

- Total records processed
- Successful vs failed normalizations
- Intervention mappings created
- Condition mappings created
- New canonical entities created
- Processing duration and performance
- Error details and affected records
- Batch completion rates

ROLLBACK SAFETY FEATURES:

- Pre-migration backup: intervention_research_pre_migration_backup_*.db
- Per-run backup: intervention_research_batch_migration_backup_*.db
- Current state backup before rollback
- Command: python batch_migration_normalization.py --rollback [backup_file]

VERIFICATION AND MONITORING:

Query to check migration progress:
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN normalized = 1 THEN 1 END) as normalized_records,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN intervention_canonical_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as intervention_mapped,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN condition_canonical_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as condition_mapped
FROM interventions;
```

EXAMPLE PRODUCTION RUN:

```bash
# Off-hours batch migration (recommended)
nohup python batch_migration_normalization.py > migration.log 2>&1 &

# Monitor progress
tail -f data/logs/batch_migration_*.log

# Verify completion
python batch_migration_normalization.py --verify-only
```

SUCCESS CRITERIA MET:

[SUCCESS] Database backed up before migration
[SUCCESS] Batch processing system implemented (100 records/batch)
[SUCCESS] Progress logging and error tracking working
[SUCCESS] Rollback plan implemented with backup restoration
[SUCCESS] find_or_create_mapping integration working
[SUCCESS] Canonical ID assignment and normalized flag tracking
[SUCCESS] Performance optimization for off-hours operation
[SUCCESS] Command line interface for flexible operation
[SUCCESS] Verification system for migration completeness

The batch migration system successfully achieves the success check:
ALL EXISTING RECORDS CAN BE NORMALIZED WHILE PRESERVING ORIGINALS!

NEXT STEPS FOR DEPLOYMENT:

1. Schedule migration during off-hours/maintenance window
2. Run: python batch_migration_normalization.py
3. Monitor logs: tail -f data/logs/batch_migration_*.log
4. Verify completion: --verify-only flag
5. Database will be fully normalized with canonical mappings

The batch migration system is READY FOR PRODUCTION deployment!
