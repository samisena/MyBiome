    "title": "Evaluating the safety outcomes of whole blood versus component transfusion in trauma: A meta-analysis of 59,213 patients.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Blood transfusion can play a critical role in saving lives by replenishing lost blood volume and helping to stabilize patients. This meta-analysis aims to compare the clinical effectiveness of whole blood (WB) transfusion against component therapy (CT) in the treatment of individuals suffering from traumatic injuries. METHODS: A comprehensive search of electronic databases was conducted up to March 2025 to identify randomized controlled trials and cohort studies. Data from continuous and categorical outcomes were synthesized using a random-effects model, producing mean differences (MD) and odds ratios (OR) along with corresponding 95\u00a0% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A random-effects meta-analysis of 14 studies showed a significant reduction in 24-h all-cause mortality with whole blood transfusion compared to component therapy (OR: 0.67, 95\u00a0% CI [0.50, 0.88]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). No significant differences were found between the two groups for length of hospital stay, ICU stay, days on ventilator, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), or sepsis. Specifically, the length of hospital stay (WMD: -1.57, p\u00a0=\u00a00.06), ICU stay (WMD: -0.20, p\u00a0=\u00a00.75), days on ventilator (WMD: -0.57, p\u00a0=\u00a00.24), ARDS (OR: 1.34, p\u00a0=\u00a00.30), and AKI (OR: 0.91, p\u00a0=\u00a00.63) showed no statistically significant differences, while sepsis (WMD: 1.10, p\u00a0=\u00a00.74) also revealed no significant variation between the groups. Removal of certain studies reduced heterogeneity in several outcomes. CONCLUSION: Although whole blood has been demonstrated to improve 24-h mortality, the current findings are limited by observational data to classify it as a completely safe approach, thus necessitating the need for more randomized controlled trials (RCTs).",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Large number of decompensated liver cirrhosis patients in China have been diagnosed with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) can possibly cure decompensated liver cirrhosis because of their self-renewal and multidirectional differentiation potential. AIM: To explore the safety and effect of treating liver cirrhosis with HBV by hUC-MSCs. METHODS: Twenty-four participants were recruited, divided into 3 groups, and injected with different amounts of hUC-MSCs via the peripheral vein. Therapy was administered 3 times. A 24-week follow-up examination of each patient's liver function, coagulation function, general condition, and immune system was performed. Adverse events were also recorded. A 2-year survival assessment was subsequently performed. RESULTS: Infusion therapy rapidly improved liver function. Serum albumin transiently increased on days 57 and 85 but returned to baseline by day 169, while prothrombin time activity demonstrated sustained improvement from day 29 through day 169. Interleukin-8 levels decreased persistently throughout treatment. All dosage groups achieved 100% 6-month survival; 2-year survival rates were 66.7% (low-dose), 100% (medium-dose), and 87.5% (high-dose). The interaction between dosage and efficacy was weak. Notably, the improvement in liver function was statistically significant and sustained for almost 3 months, suggesting clinically meaningful therapeutic durability. CONCLUSION: hUC-MSCs can be considered a safe treatment for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis associated with HBV. However, larger-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to prove its therapeutic effect.",

    "title": "Does the use of a ureteral access sheath improve perioperative outcomes in ureteroscopy? A real-world multi-institutional study.",
    "abstract": "Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) is commonly performed with a ureteral access sheath (UAS). Our objective was to evaluate the impact of UAS use in patients undergoing RIRS for renal stones. We conducted a retrospective, multicenter cohort study of all patients who underwent RIRS for kidney stones between January 2017 and December 2018 at six academic medical centers. Patients were stratified according to UAS use. To adjust for baseline differences, we applied inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), a propensity score-based method that balances covariates between groups. A total of 1,177 patients were included: 740 (62.8%) underwent RIRS with a UAS and 437 (37.2%) without. After adjustment, adequate balance was achieved between groups. In IPTW analysis, the stone-free rate (SFR) at three months was comparable between groups (OR\u2009=\u20090.75; 95% CI [0.53-1.08]; p\u2009=\u20090.12). UAS use was associated with longer operative time (estimate\u2009=\u20093.71\u00a0min; 95% CI [1.08-7.32]; p\u2009=\u20090.04), lower probability of outpatient procedure (OR\u2009=\u20090.67; 95% CI [0.49-0.91]; p\u2009=\u20090.01), and higher likelihood of postoperative stenting (OR\u2009=\u20093.61; 95% CI [2.72-4.78]; p\u2009<\u20090.001). There were no significant differences in overall complications (OR\u2009=\u20091.16; 95% CI [0.68-1.99]; p\u2009=\u20090.57) or major complications (OR\u2009=\u20091.07; 95% CI [0.45-2.57]; p\u2009=\u20090.86). In this large multicenter retrospective study, UAS use during RIRS was associated with a similar stone-free rate but increased perioperative morbidity. These real-world findings suggest that routine UAS use may not always be necessary, although randomized controlled trials are required to define its role more definitively.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Firsekibart, an anti-interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated more sustained control of gout flares compared with compound betamethasone in previous clinical studies. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of firsekibart versus etoricoxib for the treatment of frequent gout flares. METHODS: In this phase 2, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter study (NCT05936268), adults with gout according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2015 criteria experiencing frequent flares (\u2265\u20092 flares within 12 months pre-screening) were randomized (1:1) to receive either a single subcutaneous injection of firsekibart 200 mg, or once-daily oral etoricoxib 120 mg administered until pain remission or treatment intolerance for up to 8 days. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in target joint pain intensity (0-100 mm visual analogue scale [VAS]) 72 h post-treatment. Non-inferiority (margin: 10 mm) was assessed first; if achieved, superiority was subsequently evaluated. Safety was also evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 123 patients received firsekibart (n\u2009=\u200961) or etoricoxib (n\u2009=\u200962). Firsekibart was non-inferior and superior to etoricoxib in change from baseline in target joint pain VAS scores at 72 h post-treatment (difference:\u2009-\u200910.91 mm; 95% confidence interval [CI]:\u2009-\u200918.11,\u2009-\u20093.72). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 77.0% (n\u2009=\u200947) and 51.6% (n\u2009=\u200932) of patients receiving firsekibart and etoricoxib, respectively. The most common TEAE in both groups was hypertriglyceridemia. No TEAEs led to treatment discontinuation or study withdrawal, and no treatment-related serious adverse events (AEs) or deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with etoricoxib, firsekibart provides superior target joint pain relief and is well-tolerated in patients with frequent gout flares.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) injection is a beneficial therapy for bone-tendon interface (BTI) regeneration following rotator cuff (RC) repair. However, the optimal timing for BMAC injection remains undetermined. Injection at different timepoints may influence BTI regeneration. METHODS: After concentrating bone marrow (BM) to obtain BMAC, the viability of cells, nucleated cell content, platelet count, stem cell number, and concentration of growth factors in both BM and BMAC were comparatively evaluated. Supraspinatus tendon tears were induced at the greater tuberosity in 152 Wistar rats. Three weeks after the tear induction, the rats following RC repair surgery were then randomly divided into four groups based on the timing of BMAC injection: PBS injected immediately during RC repair (PBS group), BMAC injected immediately (P0-BMAC group), on postoperative day 7 (P7-BMAC group), or day 14 (P14-BMAC group). Eight weeks after RC repair, the supraspinatus tendon-proximal humerus complexes were harvested for evaluating BTI regeneration using micro-CT, histological and biomechanical testing. Additionally, at the day 0, 3, 10, 17 after RC repair, the specimens were harvested for evaluating the inflammation and oxidative stress. RESULTS: Cell viability in the BMAC exceeded 90%. The BMAC contained higher concentrations of platelets, nucleated cells, stem cells, TGF\u03b21, and IGF1 compared to BM. In vivo results demonstrated that the BMAC injection on postoperative day 7 had a more pronounced effect on BTI regeneration compared to other timepoints. Micro-CT analysis revealed that the new bone in the P7-BMAC group formed and remodelled significantly better than in the P14-BMAC, P0-BMAC, or PBS groups. Histologically, the P7-BMAC group exhibited a significantly higher rate of fibrocartilage regeneration at the RC healing site compared to the P14-BMAC, P0-BMAC, or PBS groups. Biomechanically, the P7-BMAC group showed significantly higher failure load and stiffness compared to the P14-BMAC, P0-BMAC, or PBS groups. Moreover, the P7-BMAC group showed significantly inhibiting inflammation and decreasing oxidative stress in the ST-proximal humerus complexes as compared with the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: BMAC injected at 7 days postoperatively is an optimal timing of the BMAC Injection for BTI regeneration in a chronic rat RCT model.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota influence the severity of pneumonia by producing metabolites that enhance systemic and pulmonary immune responses. Preclinical studies suggested that gut microbiota-derived indoles have protective effects against numerous diseases, including influenza and abdominal infections. However, the precise role of tryptophan metabolites during pneumonia is unknown. Here, we perform translational analyses in a large general-population cohort (n\u2009=\u200913,464), critically ill patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP; n\u2009=\u2009158; NCT01905033), a randomized human intervention trial on antibiotic-mediated microbiota modulation (NCT03051698), and mice to investigate the effects of tryptophan metabolites, specifically indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), on pneumonia. In the population-based cohort, baseline IAA is associated with a higher risk of future hospital admission for pneumonia (cause-specific hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.09-1.22 p\u2009<\u20090.0001). In patients with severe CAP higher levels of IAA are associated with increased mortality, independent from potential confounders (hazard ratio 1.30 per log2 increase, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.68, p\u2009=\u20090.037). In a mouse model of bacterial pneumonia, IAA supplementation aggravates pulmonary damage while reducing systemic dissemination, which is mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and increased release of reactive oxygen species from neutrophils. In summary, these findings from general population and severe pneumonia cohorts, and murine pneumonia experiments, show that the gut microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolite IAA affects pneumonia, suggesting that various indoles may have diverging, context-dependent effects.",

    "abstract": "Preclinical evidence suggests positive symptomatic and neuroprotective effects of hypoxic conditioning in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study (NCT05214287) investigated the safety, feasibility, short-term symptomatic and downstream effects of hypoxic conditioning in individuals with PD. 20 individuals with PD (mean age 62, 10 women, Hoehn-Yahr 1.5-3) completed randomized controlled double-blinded multiple N-of-1 trials. Each participant underwent five different 45-minute hypoxia interventions in duplicate: continuous hypoxia at FiO2 0.163 and 0.127, intermittent (five-minute intervals interspersed with normoxia) at FiO2 0.163 and 0.127, and placebo. Primary outcomes were safety and feasibility as measured by adverse events, vital parameter disturbances, participant-rated discomfort and feasibility questionnaires. Secondary outcomes were short-term participant-rated and assessor-rated symptom scores. Exploratory indicators of target engagement were serum erythropoietin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light-chain (NfL), platelet-derived growth factor-receptor-\u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) and cortisol. Secondary outcomes were evaluated using frequentist and Bayesian analysis. 20 participants completed the protocol. The trial met its primary endpoints for safety and feasibility. 95 adverse events occurred, including one moderate and three serious events. Adverse events were not dose-dependent and occurred at comparable incidence following hypoxia and placebo. Hypoxic conditioning was well-tolerated. Low-FIO2 protocols caused significant oxygen desaturations in two participants. Participants considered longer-term application feasible. Intermittent hypoxia at FIO2 0.163 modestly improved most participant-rated symptoms for several hours compared to placebo, but not assessor-rated scales. One hour after intervention, serum markers did not differ between interventions. Hypoxic conditioning is safe and feasible in individuals with PD, and specific protocols may be associated with short-term symptom improvement. These findings inform and support follow-up studies of longer-term safety and efficacy of hypoxic conditioning.",

    "abstract": "Depression, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders commonly occur in the perinatal period, with high rates of comorbidity, and potentially adverse outcomes for women and children. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment, however less than half of new mothers experiencing symptoms seek treatment. This review was focused on factors affecting treatment engagement and outcome in a clinical perinatal population. A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted according to Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of individual CBT where at least 70% of women met diagnostic criteria for depression, anxiety, or trauma-related disorders during the perinatal period. Information on, and factors associated with treatment engagement, satisfaction, therapeutic alliance were examined as risk ratios (RRs). Twenty-eight studies relating to 19 RCTs, with 2557 participants were reviewed. Most studies examined CBT adapted to the perinatal context. Engagement was good overall, and high levels of satisfaction and therapeutic alliance were reported. A relationship was demonstrated between engagement and outcome in three studies. Dropout did not differ for studies of CBT compared to treatment as usual (TAU), but there was greater dropout for CBT across four studies where the guiding therapist/coach had a minimal level of psychological therapy training and qualifications (k\u2009=\u20094; n\u2009=\u2009675; RR 2.38; CI 1.17-4.83). Findings indicate the importance of engagement, which may be optimized by adapting CBT to be relevant to the unique challenges faced by women in the perinatal period, and through therapeutic provision from therapists with at least a moderate amount of psychological therapy training and qualifications.",

    "title": "Large Language Models in Lung Cancer: Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the era of data and intelligence, artificial intelligence has been widely applied in the medical field. As the most cutting-edge technology, the large language model (LLM) has gained popularity due to its extraordinary ability to handle complex tasks and interactive features. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically review current applications of LLMs in lung cancer (LC) care and evaluate their potential across the full-cycle management spectrum. METHODS: Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive literature search across 6 databases up to January 1, 2025. Studies were included if they satisfied the following criteria: (1) journal articles, conference papers, and preprints; (2) studies that reported the content of LLMs in LC; (3) including original data and LC-related data presented separately; and (4) studies published in English. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) books and book chapters, letters, reviews, conference proceedings; (2) studies that did not report the content of LLMs in LC; and (3) no original data, and LC-related data that are not presented separately. Studies were screened independently by 2 authors (SC and ZL) and assessed for quality using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2, Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool, and Risk Of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions tools, selected based on study type. Key data items extracted included model type, application scenario, prompt method, input and output format, outcome measures, and safety considerations. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Out of 706 studies screened, 28 were included (published between 2023 and 2024). The ability of LLMs to automatically extract medical records, popularize general knowledge about LC, and assist clinical diagnosis and treatment has been demonstrated through the systematic review, emerging visual ability, and multimodal potential. Prompt engineering was a critical component, with varying degrees of sophistication from zero-shot to fine-tuned approaches. Quality assessments revealed overall acceptable methodological rigor but noted limitations in bias control and data security reporting. CONCLUSIONS: LLMs show considerable potential in improving LC diagnosis, communication, and decision-making. However, their responsible use requires attention to privacy, interpretability, and human oversight.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is among the most frequent and disabling non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), often emerging early and substantially impacting autonomy and quality of life. While cognitive stimulation (CS) is supported in other neurodegenerative conditions, its role in PD is less explored. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of a therapist-guided, home-based CS program, delivered via a virtual reality rehabilitation system, with a conventional in-person CS intervention. METHODS: Of 123 individuals screened, 45 patients with PD and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) were randomized to either the tele-rehabilitation group (TRG; n\u2009=\u200925) or the control group (CG; n\u2009=\u200920). Both groups received the same standardized 4-week CS program (20 multi-domain sessions, 5\u00a0days/week), targeting memory, attention, executive functions, language, and visuospatial skills. The TRG trained at home via the VRRS platform under remote supervision, while the CG attended outpatient sessions. Neuropsychological and clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 6-month follow-up (T3). Analyses included repeated-measures ANOVA, multivariate linear regression, and categorical comparisons based on predefined clinical cut-offs. RESULTS: All participants completed the intervention with adherence exceeding 90% in both groups. At T2, the TRG showed greater improvements than the CG in global cognition, working memory, and delayed recall. These effects remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, baseline performance, and cognitive reserve index, and were robust to false discovery rate correction. Regression models confirmed these improvements. Categorical analyses also showed a marked reduction in pathological scores in the TRG in the same domains. CONCLUSION: A short-term, therapist-guided CS program delivered via tele-rehabilitation effectively improved cognitive functioning in PD-MCI, with partial benefits maintained at 6 months, especially in memory and executive domains. The intervention was particularly beneficial for memory and executive functions, highlighting telemedicine as a promising and accessible option for cognitive care in PD.",

METHODS: This prospective study was carried out from 2022-02-16 to 2025-02-16 and included patients attending our hospital to collect clinical data, with surgery performed by the same attending surgeon. Patients with RFs determined by X-ray or CT 1-3 days after RIRS were selected and randomly divided into a treatment group (PDLS intervention) and a control group (conventional instruction). Patients in the treatment group were treated with preoperative water to hold urine and PDLS for 10\u00a0min, adverse effects and stone expulsion were recorded, and stone clearance status was determined by mean imaging follow-up for 20 days. The sample size was calculated using PASS 11 software, and 136 samples were identified for participation in the experiment, and the data were analysed using R 4.3.0 statistical analysis software. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of baseline characteristics such as Age, BMI, CT value, Gender, Hypertension, Diabetes, Respiratory disease, History of RIRS surgery, Haematuria, Back pain and Fever (P\u2009>\u20090.05). However, in terms of stone-free rate, the PDLS\u2009+\u2009RIRS group had a significantly higher stone-free rate (91.67%) than the RIRS group (75.00%), and the difference was statistically significant (\u03c7\u00b2=6.94, P\u2009=\u20090.008). CONCLUSION: Studies have shown that the PDLS\u2009+\u2009RIRS surgical approach has higher efficiency and advantages in stone removal, which can be used as a reference for clinical treatment.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: ECT is a well-established treatment modality for severe psychiatric disorders, particularly major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. It is well-documented that patients experience significant anxiety before treatment, which can adversely affect nursing care and the treatment process. This study aims to determine the effect of progressive muscle relaxation exercises on anxiety levels among patients with bipolar and depressive disorders prior to their first ECT session. METHOD: Data for this quasi-experimental study were collected from 30 in-patients with bipolar disorder and depression who received ECT for the first time in the hospital between May 29 and October 29, 2020. Data collection involved an information form, the STAXI State Anxiety Scale, and the Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the Friedman test, and the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The mean VAS-A score decreased from 4.93\u2009\u00b1\u20091.88 before PMR to 2.83\u2009\u00b1\u20091.76 after PMR, and further to 1.43\u2009\u00b1\u20091.21 after ECT (p\u2009<\u2009.001). However, STAI-S scores did not show a statistically significant difference before and after PMR (p\u2009>\u2009.05). Heart rate and respiratory rate also significantly decreased after PMR exercises (p\u2009<\u2009.05), while oxygen saturation remained unchanged. Prior to the next ECT session, the mean VAS-A score increased to 5.10\u2009\u00b1\u20091.77, and no significant changes were observed in either physiological parameters or anxiety measures. CONCLUSION: While a short-term effect on VAS Anxiety levels was observed following PMR exercises before ECT, patients still exhibited high levels of anxiety before subsequent ECT sessions. Therefore, it is recommended that PMR exercises be performed before each ECT session, and the effects of long-term application should be further investigated. Future studies should employ a randomized controlled design to compare results with a control group. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vaccination rates of immunosuppressed liver transplant recipients need to improve. We compared the effectiveness of a three-arm randomized intervention on vaccination rates in liver transplant recipients. METHODS: Two hundred and eighty-nine liver transplant recipients were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) patient intervention, (2) family physician intervention, and (3) combined patient and family physician intervention. The intervention consisted of a yellow information letter, which was personalized and sent to either the patient (1), the family physician (2), or both (3) in December 2016. RESULTS: Irrespective of the assigned intervention group, a significant increase in vaccination rates from baseline to follow-up after 2\u00a0years was observed for tetanus (53%-56%), pertussis (52%-57%), hepatitis\u00a0A (44%-49%), hepatitis\u00a0B (64%-71%), pneumococci (68%-75%), and the sequential pneumococcal vaccination (12%-22%). Comparing the interventions, the vaccination rate for hepatitis\u00a0A was significantly higher at follow-up for intervention (3) (OR = 9.07, p = 0.043) and (2) (OR = 9.91, p = 0.034) than for intervention (1). Concerning the vaccination rate for hepatitis\u00a0B, an odds ratio of 9.13 was observed for intervention (2) (p = 0.006) compared to (1). Interventions (2) and (3) were generally superior to the patient-centered intervention alone, with the exception of influenza vaccination. CONCLUSION: The results show the importance of family physicians in improving vaccination rates in liver transplant recipients. Establishing low-threshold communication channels, for example, via the electronic patient record, could improve cooperation between physicians in specialized outpatient clinics and family physicians.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tackling poor mental health in university students is a priority in higher education. Although major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are highly prevalent among university students and predict impaired university and later life outcomes, most students do not receive evidence-based treatment. Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy (iCBT) is increasingly offered to UK university students in guided or unguided formats. Our aim is to compare the effects of guided versus unguided scalable iCBT for university students with elevated symptoms of depression and/or anxiety and to investigate the feasibility of creating individual treatment rules (ITR) to predict for whom which variant of iCBT is more effective as well as for whom neither is effective. METHODS: An online single-blind, two-arm parallel-group randomized controlled trial to examine symptoms of depression and anxiety across 3\u00a0months in university students aged over 16 who screen into the study with self-reported high levels of anxiety (GAD-7\u2009>\u20099) and/or depression (PHQ-9\u2009>\u20099). Eligible participants will be randomized to guided transdiagnostic iCBT supported by a psychological wellbeing practitioner or to the same transdiagnostic iCBT content as unguided self-help. In total, 720 participants with no current bipolar disorder or psychosis will be recruited from UK universities. Assessments will take place at baseline (pre-randomization) and 3\u00a0months post-randomization. Primary endpoints and outcomes are self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms at 3-month follow-up, adjusting for baseline scores. Well-being, health-related quality of life, functioning and academic outcomes are secondary outcomes. Compliance, adverse events, and potentially mediating variables will be monitored. We will use machine learning to estimate heterogeneity of treatment effects and develop an ITR to optimize the allocation of students to either unguided or guided iCBT. DISCUSSION: The trial aims to provide a better understanding of the relative benefits of guided and unguided iCBT for anxiety and depression in university students with considerable implications for treatment coverage and service planning and delivery. We will provide innovative information to optimize treatment assignment, guide university mental health treatment planning and support evidence-based and scalable interventions for the most common mental health problems in university students.

    "title": "The Role of Early Rehabilitation in Treatment of Acute Pulmonary Embolism-A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition that frequently results in persistent exertional dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, and psychological distress, even after acute-phase management. Despite growing recognition of post-PE impairments, structured early rehabilitation remains underutilized. This narrative review aims to evaluate current evidence on the role, components, and outcomes of early rehabilitation strategies following acute PE. Methods: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library. Articles published between 2020 and 2025 were screened for relevance to early rehabilitation in PE patients. Inclusion criteria prioritized randomized controlled trials, prospective studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews. Study quality was assessed using Cochrane, Newcastle-Ottawa, and AMSTAR 2 tools. Results: Out of 306 records, 158 studies were included. Early pulmonary rehabilitation-including aerobic and resistance exercise, inspiratory muscle training, and psychological support-demonstrated improvements in functional capacity, dyspnea, and quality of life, without adverse effects. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D may further mitigate thromboembolic risk via anti-inflammatory pathways. However, evidence remains predominantly observational, with limited high-quality data addressing timing, dosage, and patient stratification. Conclusions: Early, individualized rehabilitation appears safe and potentially beneficial in improving recovery and limiting complications after acute PE. Nonetheless, the absence of robust randomized trials underscores the urgent need for hypothesis-driven research to establish standardized, evidence-based rehabilitation protocols and guidelines tailored to risk stratification and patient phenotype, so as not to prolong recovery time and keep survivors from becoming disabled.",

    "title": "Role of Prucalopride in the Treatment of Chronic Constipation in Parkinson's Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Constipation, a prevalent nonmotor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), adversely impacts patients' quality of life. Prucalopride, a selective 5-HT4 receptor agonist, has shown efficacy as a treatment for functional constipation, but its role in PD-related constipation remains underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, safety, and quality-of-life impact of prucalopride in PD patients with chronic constipation. METHODS: In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, PD patients with chronic constipation received prucalopride (2 mg) or placebo once daily for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in the number of spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week from baseline to week 8. Secondary outcomes included stool consistency, straining, and changes in Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptoms and Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life scores. Parkinsonian motor severity was assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were included (prucalopride = 30, placebo = 27). At week 8, the change in the number of weekly SBMs was significantly larger in the prucalopride group (3.2 \u00b1 2.8) than in the placebo group (1.6 \u00b1 1.9; P = 0.02). Longitudinal analysis confirmed a significantly higher SBM frequency in the prucalopride group throughout the 8-week period (P = 0.015). Secondary outcomes showed trends toward improvement, but no statistically significant differences. No serious adverse events were reported, and UPDRS scores remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: Prucalopride was safe, well-tolerated, and more effective than placebo in increasing bowel movement frequency in PD patients with chronic constipation, supporting its potential as a therapeutic option in this population.",
