Generated: 2025-10-14 23:42:00

================================================================================

## Executive Summary

Tested hierarchical clustering with distance_threshold = 0.7 vs 0.8 across all three entity types (interventions, conditions, mechanisms). This analysis compares quantitative metrics and qualitative cluster quality to determine the optimal threshold.

## Key Findings

### 1. Cluster Count Changes (22-24% reduction with 0.8)

| Entity Type  | 0.7 Clusters | 0.8 Clusters | Reduction |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| Interventions| 538          | 420          | -21.9%    |
| Conditions   | 330          | 251          | -23.9%    |
| Mechanisms   | 130          | 101          | -22.3%    |

**Interpretation**: Threshold 0.8 produces ~22-24% fewer clusters (more consolidation) across all entity types.

### 2. Silhouette Score (higher is better)

| Entity Type  | 0.7 Score | 0.8 Score | Change    | Winner |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Interventions| 0.118     | 0.135     | +14.8%    | 0.8 [BETTER] |
| Conditions   | 0.104     | 0.118     | +13.5%    | 0.8 [BETTER] |
| Mechanisms   | 0.134     | 0.146     | +9.3%     | 0.8 [BETTER] |

**Interpretation**: Threshold 0.8 shows consistent silhouette score improvement (+9-15%) across all entity types, indicating better cluster cohesion (members within clusters are more similar to each other).

### 3. Davies-Bouldin Score (lower is better)

| Entity Type  | 0.7 Score | 0.8 Score | Change    | Winner |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Interventions| 0.588     | 0.849     | +44.5%    | 0.7 [BETTER] |
| Conditions   | 0.586     | 0.864     | +47.5%    | 0.7 [BETTER] |
| Mechanisms   | 0.666     | 0.903     | +35.6%    | 0.7 [BETTER] |

**Interpretation**: Threshold 0.8 shows Davies-Bouldin score degradation (+36-48%) across all entity types, indicating reduced cluster separation (clusters are closer together, potentially overlapping).

### 4. Metric Contradiction Analysis

**Conflicting Signals**:
- Silhouette score favors 0.8 (better intra-cluster cohesion)
- Davies-Bouldin score favors 0.7 (better inter-cluster separation)

**Why This Happens**:
1. **Threshold 0.8** merges more aggressively:
   - Creates tighter, more homogeneous clusters (good silhouette)
   - But reduces separation between clusters (bad DB score)
   - Example: "Cognitive training" merges from 4 â†’ 9 members

2. **Threshold 0.7** is more conservative:
   - Maintains better separation between distinct concepts (good DB score)
   - But may have looser intra-cluster cohesion (worse silhouette)
   - Example: Keeps specialized cognitive training types separate

**Interpretation**: This is a classic precision vs recall trade-off in clustering:
- 0.7 = Higher precision (keeps distinct concepts separate)
- 0.8 = Higher recall (consolidates related concepts more aggressively)

### 5. Qualitative Cluster Quality Assessment

**Mechanism Clusters @ 0.8 (sample inspection)**:

#### GOOD MERGES:
1. **Cluster 12 (9 members)**: "Cognitive function enhancement via multi-domain training"
   - Consolidates: multi-domain training, computerized training, gamified training, VR training, personalized training
   - VERDICT: Appropriate consolidation of cognitive training modalities

2. **Cluster 11 (7 members)**: "Behavioral adherence enhancement via education and digital tools"
   - Consolidates: education, video observation, reminders, digital engagement, monitoring
   - VERDICT: Appropriate consolidation of adherence strategies

3. **Cluster 35 (3 members)**: "Antibiotic treatment for H. pylori eradication"
   - Same as 0.7 Cluster 17 (both have 3 members)
   - VERDICT: No change - stable cluster

#### POTENTIAL OVER-MERGING:
- **Cluster 12**: May have merged overly specific training types (e.g., "gamified" vs "VR-based" could be distinct mechanisms)
- Need manual review of full member lists to confirm

**Mechanism Clusters @ 0.7 (sample inspection)**:

#### GOOD SEPARATION:
1. **Cluster 28 (5 members)**: "Behavioral Adherence through Education and Monitoring"
   - More conservative than 0.8 Cluster 11 (7 members)
   - VERDICT: Good precision

2. **Cluster 55 (4 members)**: "Cognitive training enhancement"
   - Split into specialized subtypes vs 0.8's merged 9-member cluster
   - VERDICT: Better for preserving distinctions

## Recommendation

### Quantitative Evidence:
- **Silhouette favors 0.8**: +9-15% improvement
- **Davies-Bouldin favors 0.7**: +36-48% better separation
- **Mixed signals**: Need qualitative tie-breaker

### Qualitative Evidence:
- **0.8 merges appropriately** in most cases (cognitive training, adherence strategies)
- **0.8 may over-merge** some specialized mechanisms (requires full review)
- **0.7 preserves distinctions** better (H. pylori antibiotics, behavioral adherence)

### Domain-Specific Considerations:
- **Medical mechanisms are naturally hierarchical**: E.g., "antibiotic treatment for H. pylori" has subtypes (sequential regimen, resistant strains)
- **Over-consolidation risks**: Merging distinct biological pathways can obscure important differences
- **Under-consolidation risks**: Splitting related mechanisms fragments evidence

### FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Use Threshold 0.7

**Rationale**:
1. **Medical domain context**: Mechanisms often have critical distinctions (e.g., "EGFR inhibition" vs "VEGF inhibition" are different pathways)
2. **Davies-Bouldin degradation is severe**: +36-48% is a large jump, indicating significant overlap between clusters
3. **Silhouette improvement is modest**: +9-15% is nice but not compelling enough to override separation loss
4. **Precision > Recall for medical data**: Better to keep distinct mechanisms separate than risk inappropriate merging
5. **Evidence from 0.6 vs 0.7 comparison**: We previously found 0.7 had superior semantic grouping over 0.6

**What to do with 0.8**:
- **Archive experiments 27-29** (threshold 0.8) for reference
- **Use threshold 0.7** for production experiments
- **Update base configuration** with distance_threshold: 0.7

## Next Steps

1. **Update base_config.yaml** to set distance_threshold: 0.7 for all entity types
2. **Archive threshold 0.8 results** (keep for future reference)
3. **Generate final cluster member lists** for threshold 0.7 experiments (already done)
4. **Optional**: Manual quality review of threshold 0.7 clusters to mark GOOD/QUESTIONABLE/BAD
5. **Optional**: Test intermediate value (e.g., 0.75) if further refinement needed

## Supporting Data

### Cluster Size Distribution

**0.7 Mechanisms (130 clusters)**:
- Largest cluster: 5 members (Behavioral Adherence)
- Top 3 clusters: 5, 4, 3 members
- Singleton clusters: 0

**0.8 Mechanisms (101 clusters)**:
- Largest cluster: 9 members (Cognitive function enhancement)
- Top 3 clusters: 9, 7, 4 members
- Singleton clusters: 0

**Observation**: 0.8 creates larger mega-clusters (9 members vs 5 members), indicating more aggressive consolidation.

### Performance Comparison

| Threshold | Duration (exp 26/29) | Naming Efficiency |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 0.7       | 125.9s              | 130 clusters      |
| 0.8       | 313.1s              | 101 clusters      |

**Note**: 0.8 took longer despite fewer clusters due to larger cluster naming complexity (more members per cluster = longer LLM prompts).

## Conclusion

**Use distance_threshold = 0.7** for hierarchical clustering in the unified Phase 3 pipeline. This threshold provides the best balance between consolidation and separation for medical mechanism clustering, as evidenced by:
- Superior Davies-Bouldin score (better cluster separation)
- Good qualitative cluster coherence (from 0.6 vs 0.7 comparison)
- Appropriate granularity for medical domain distinctions

The silhouette score improvement with 0.8 is outweighed by the severe Davies-Bouldin degradation and risk of inappropriate merging in the medical domain.
