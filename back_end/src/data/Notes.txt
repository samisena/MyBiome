-> Only full text metadata gets saved to the database
Actual text gets saved as JSON files.
-> We're not at the stage where we are ready to process full texts yet

-> Graph will need to be updated periodically when new data is added

-> Dynamic taxonomy expansion based on discovered
interventions

-> Integration with medical ontologies (MeSH,
SNOMED)

-> human-in-the-loop validation

-> Consider PostgreSQL for better concurrency

-> Finalize the dual LLM approach (voting etc)

-> Check if the LLMs consensus handles captioning overlap 'ibs' 'IBS' 


LLm:

-> Consider fine tuning

-> In config.py why is: self.intervention_batch_size = 5
    and self.max_papers_per_condition = 100 ?

Quality assurance workflow: first model extracts → validation catches issues
→ second model verifies problematic extractions → humans review what both
models couldn't handle.
-> This might not be the best practice. Check Notion AI folder for practices like voting.

Hybrid Strategy:
Process ALL papers with abstracts (baseline data)
ENHANCE the subset with full text when available. (Use powerful models)
Two-tier relationship confidence scoring (abstract only vs full text)

IMPORTANT TODO - DELIVERY METHOD TAXONOMY FIX:
September 22, 2025 - Fixed delivery method validation taxonomy to include:
- acupuncture/needling methods
- nasal/intranasal delivery
- enema/rectal applications
- subcutaneous/intramuscular injections
- neuromodulation/electrical stimulation
- local applications

ACTION REQUIRED BEFORE DATA MINING:
Re-process papers that had validation failures for delivery methods before
the taxonomy fix. These papers (processed before paper ~110 in current
batch) may have had valid interventions rejected due to restrictive
delivery method validation. Consider re-running LLM extraction on papers
with intervention_count = 0 where validation failures occurred.

Query to identify affected papers:
SELECT paper_id FROM papers WHERE processed_date < '2025-09-22 16:30:00'
AND paper_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT paper_id FROM interventions)
