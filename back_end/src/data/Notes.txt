Code Review:
-> search_terms.py, are these the only terms? or is the LLM allowed to extract new ones
that aren't mentioned explicitely.

LLm:
-> Token limit is set to 4098 in config.py. Remove token output limit in case there 
are numerous strains mentioned. (Why have a token limit in the first place?)

-> In config.py why is: self.intervention_batch_size = 5
    and self.max_papers_per_condition = 100 ?

-> Process papers with high popularity score first

-> Strongly consider fine tuning as tasks become increasingly difficult for the LLM.

-> Consider side chaining tasks: first extract key terms from abstarct, then a seperate prompt turns that into JSON 
format

-> Investigate why out of 50 papers only 2 correlations were extracted.

Quality assurance workflow: first model extracts → validation catches issues 
→ second model verifies problematic extractions → humans review what both 
models couldn't handle. (Check)
-> This might not be the best practice. Check Notion AI folder for practices like voting.

Hybrid Strategy:
Process ALL papers with abstracts (baseline data)
ENHANCE the subset with full text when available. (Use powerful models)
Two-tier relationship confidence scoring (abstract only vs full text)



Paper search:
-> Semantic scholar AI (free): tool to find high impact papers.Papers that were cited many times.
+ AI paper influence score
+ Vector similairty to find similar papers
+ Structured extraction of key paper sections (methods and results)
+ Identifies key researchers in the field 

-> The batch limit of semantic scholar is not 500. Its just 500 per 5 seconds for those who
don't use an API key.
-> Semantic search returns only 10 papers by default, we might want to increase that limit

-> Start analyzing papers in batches overnight

-> Citation analyzer: Identifies the most cited/influential papers in your field
-> Related paper discovery: Finds papers you might miss with keyword-only search
-> Author network analysis: Identifies key researchers in probiotic research
-> Impact scoring: Prioritizes papers by citation count and influence

-> Only full text metadata gets saved to the database
Actual text gets saved as JSON files.
