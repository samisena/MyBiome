LLm:
-> Remove token output limit in case there are numerous
strains mentioned

-> Consider side chaining tasks: first extract key terms from abstarct, then a seperate prompt turns that into JSON 
format

-> Investigate why out of 50 papers only 2 correlations were extracted.

Quality assurance workflow: first model extracts → validation catches issues 
→ second model verifies problematic extractions → humans review what both 
models couldn't handle. (Check)

Hybrid Strategy:
Process ALL papers with abstracts (baseline data)
ENHANCE the subset with full text when available. (Use powerful models)
Two-tier relationship confidence scoring (abstract only vs full text)



Paper search:
-> Search Medline and Embase as well as pubmed

-> Start analyzing papers in batches overnight

-> Citation analyzer: Identifies the most cited/influential papers in your field
-> Related paper discovery: Finds papers you might miss with keyword-only search
-> Author network analysis: Identifies key researchers in probiotic research
-> Impact scoring: Prioritizes papers by citation count and influence
