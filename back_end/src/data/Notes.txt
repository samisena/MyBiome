LLm:
-> When the LLM doesn't find any probiotics it tends to default
to lactobacillus rhamnosus GG

-> Give google's Gemma2 9B a second try 

-> Try CPU offloading so that I can run larger models

-> Experiment with new models: gemma 2 9B, llama 3.2 13B and 20B,
    Qwen 2.5 14B and 32B, Mixtral 8x7B

-> Remove token output limit in case there are numerous
strains mentioned

-> Ask the LLM to first count the number of probiotics mentioned
then study them while making sure it didnt study
the same probiotic twice, and that it didn't miss any 
of the ones it counted

-> Consider side chaining tasks: first extract key terms from abstarct, then a seperate prompt turns that into JSON 
format


Paper search:
-> Search Medline as well as pubmed and Embase

-> Start analyzing papers in batches.


Quality assurance workflow: first model extracts → validation catches issues 
→ second model verifies problematic extractions → humans review what both 
models couldn't handle.



Hybrid Strategy:
Process ALL papers with abstracts (baseline data)
ENHANCE the subset with full text when available
Two-tier relationship confidence scoring (abstract only vs full text)


-> Citation analyzer: Identifies the most cited/influential papers in your field
-> Related paper discovery: Finds papers you might miss with keyword-only search
-> Author network analysis: Identifies key researchers in probiotic research
-> Impact scoring: Prioritizes papers by citation count and influence
