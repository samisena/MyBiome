-> Start analyzing papers in batches using free LLMs such as Grok. Focus on the big 5: IBS, IBD, GERD,
 constipation, diarhea.


Quality assurance workflow: first model extracts → validation catches issues 
→ second model verifies problematic extractions → humans review what both 
models couldn't handle.


Next steps:
1. Get a new PC
2. Integrate local LLMs into the workflow
3. Collect free papers
4. Start processing papers in batches (processing many papers at once)


Hybrid Strategy:
Process ALL papers with abstracts (baseline data)
ENHANCE the subset with full text when available
Two-tier relationship confidence scoring (abstract only vs full text)


-> Citation analyzer: Identifies the most cited/influential papers in your field
-> Related paper discovery: Finds papers you might miss with keyword-only search
-> Author network analysis: Identifies key researchers in probiotic research
-> Impact scoring: Prioritizes papers by citation count and influence
