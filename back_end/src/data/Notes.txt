-> Some probiotic relationships are extarcted as ...
-> Figure out a technique to fix this (double checking?)
-> Include a way for papers to be skipped if they don't
discuss probiotics instead of inserting ...
-> remove token output limit in case there are numerous
strains mentioned
-> Ask the LLM to first count the number of probiotics mentioned
then study them while making sure it didnt study
the same probiotic twice, and that it didn't miss any 
of the ones it counted



-> Start analyzing papers in batches. Focus on the big 5: IBS, IBD, GERD,
 constipation, diarhea.

-> Focus on llama only for now (meta)

-> The pipeline checks 4 times for free papers which wastes time. 2 checks are enough, otherwise it's a paywall issue.

Quality assurance workflow: first model extracts → validation catches issues 
→ second model verifies problematic extractions → humans review what both 
models couldn't handle.

-> Manually review about 100 examples and do some fine tuning (NVIDIA CEO advice)

Fine tuning approach:
1. First, manually annotate 20-30 abstracts with your relationship triples
2. Create a detailed prompt with 3-5 examples (few-shot)
3. Run this on 500-1000 abstracts to generate synthetic labels
4. Manually review and correct a subset (maybe 100-200)
5. Use this for fine-tuning with LoRA (feasible on your A2000)


Hybrid Strategy:
Process ALL papers with abstracts (baseline data)
ENHANCE the subset with full text when available
Two-tier relationship confidence scoring (abstract only vs full text)


Claude recommendations
-> Citation analyzer: Identifies the most cited/influential papers in your field
-> Related paper discovery: Finds papers you might miss with keyword-only search
-> Author network analysis: Identifies key researchers in probiotic research
-> Impact scoring: Prioritizes papers by citation count and influence
