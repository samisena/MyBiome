Actual text gets saved as JSON files.

-> Graph will need to be updated periodically when new data is added

-> Dynamic taxonomy expansion based on discovered interventions

IMPORTANT TODO - DELIVERY METHOD TAXONOMY FIX:
September 22, 2025 - Fixed delivery method validation taxonomy to include:
- acupuncture/needling methods
- nasal/intranasal delivery
- enema/rectal applications
- subcutaneous/intramuscular injections
- neuromodulation/electrical stimulation
- local applications

ACTION REQUIRED BEFORE DATA MINING:
Re-process papers that had validation failures for delivery methods before
the taxonomy fix. These papers (processed before paper ~110 in current
batch) may have had valid interventions rejected due to restrictive
delivery method validation. Consider re-running LLM extraction on papers
with intervention_count = 0 where validation failures occurred.

Query to identify affected papers:
SELECT paper_id FROM papers WHERE processed_date < '2025-09-22 16:30:00'
AND paper_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT paper_id FROM interventions)


-> Integration with medical ontologies (MeSH,
SNOMED)

-> human-in-the-loop validation

-> Consider PostgreSQL for better concurrency


LLm:

-> Consider fine tuning

-> Finalize the dual LLM approach (voting etc)

-> In config.py why is: self.intervention_batch_size = 5
    and self.max_papers_per_condition = 100 ?
