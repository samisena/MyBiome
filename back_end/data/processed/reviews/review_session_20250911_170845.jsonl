There are increasing numbers of research studies exploring treatment options involving probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), but it is still uncertain which treatment option is superior. The research was conducted on various databases and unpublished trial data (up to February 2023). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were screened for adult patients with IBS comparing interventions with placebo. Probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and FMT were assessed for their impact using mean difference and Bayesian network meta-analysis. Out of 6528 articles, 54 were included for probiotics, 7 for prebiotics/synbiotics, and 6 for FMT. Probiotics showed improvement in IBS symptoms, particularly with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains. Prebiotics and synbiotics did not show significant improvement. Network meta-analysis indicated the favorable effects of probiotics (OR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.59) and FMT (OR = 0.46, 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.64) on IBS, with no serious adverse events reported. In short, probiotics and FMT are effective for managing IBS, with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus being dominant strains. However, the most effective probiotic combination or strain remains unclear, while prebiotics and synbiotics did not show significant improvement."}, "llm_extraction": {"probiotic_strain": "Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12", "health_condition": "irritable bowel syndrome", "correlation_type": "positive", "correlation_strength": 0.8, "confidence_score": 0.9, "supporting_quote": "Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 significantly improved IBS symptoms", "extraction_model": "llama3.1:8b"}, "human_review": {"action": "wrong", "reviewer": "manual_review", "corrections": {"reason": "probiotics and FMT are effective for managing IBS, with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus being dominant strains"}, "reason": "probiotics and FMT are effective for managing IBS, with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus being dominant strains"}, "corrected_extraction": {"probiotic_strain": "Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12", "health_condition": "irritable bowel syndrome", "correlation_type": "positive", "is_correct": false, "is_reviewable": true}}

Diagnosis should be clinical based on symptoms, with limited complementary examinations for the sole purpose of differential diagnosis elimination.

Low-FODMAP diets, which involve restricting fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, have emerged as an effective dietary intervention for alleviating IBS symptoms. This review paper aims to synthesize current insights into the impact of a low-FODMAP diet on the gut microbiome and its mechanisms of action in managing IBS. We explore the alterations in microbial composition and function associated with a low-FODMAP diet and discuss the implications of these changes for gut health and symptom relief. Additionally, we examine the balance between symptom improvement and potential negative effects on microbial diversity and long-term gut health. Emerging evidence suggests that while a low-FODMAP diet can significantly reduce IBS symptoms, it may also lead to reductions in beneficial microbial populations. Strategies to mitigate these effects, such as the reintroduction phase and the use of probiotics, are evaluated. This review highlights the importance of a personalized approach to dietary management in IBS, considering individual variations in microbiome responses. Understanding the intricate relationship between diet, the gut microbiome, and IBS symptomatology will guide the development of more effective, sustainable dietary strategies for IBS patients."}, "llm_extraction": {"probiotic_strain": "Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG", "health_condition": "irritable bowel syndrome", "correlation_type": "positive", "correlation_strength": 0.0, "confidence_score": 0.0, "supporting_quote": "Emerging evidence suggests that while a low-FODMAP diet can significantly reduce IBS symptoms, it may also lead to reductions in beneficial microbial populations.", "extraction_model": "llama3.1:8b"}, "human_review": {"action": "wrong", "reviewer": "manual_review", "corrections": {"reason": "no specific strain was mentioned"}, "reason": "no specific strain was mentioned"}, "corrected_extraction": {"probiotic_strain": "Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG", "health_condition": "irritable bowel syndrome", "correlation_type": "positive", "is_correct": false, "is_reviewable": true}}

DESIGN, SETTING AND INTERVENTIONS: The six-week randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial included 31 IBS patients categorized into three groups: online yoga with probiotics (EP), online yoga with a placebo (EC), and probiotics only (P). Assessments involved physical fitness tests, subjective questionnaires (IBS-QOL, BSRS-5), and gut microbiome analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants self-collected stool samples and were given a set of questionnaires at baseline and after six weeks of intervention. Their symptoms were measured by changes in the gut microbiota, physical fitness and quality of life, and psychological well-being. RESULTS: The EP group demonstrated improved cardiovascular endurance (P < 0.001) and a significant reduction in Klebsiella bacterial strains (P < 0.05). Both the EP and EC groups exhibited significantly decreased IBS-QOL scores (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively), indicating enhanced quality of life. While BSRS-5 scores decreased in both groups, the reduction was statistically insignificant. CONCLUSION: Integrating online yoga, mindfulness practices, and probiotics demonstrated comprehensive benefits for IBS patients. This intervention improved physical fitness and mental well-being and positively influenced gut microbiota composition. The study highlights the potential of this multifaceted approach in managing IBS symptoms and enhancing overall health, emphasizing the relevance of the gut-muscle-brain axis in understanding and addressing IBS complexities.

To help meet this demand, the safety and efficacy of daily supplementation of Bacillus subtilis BS50 for 6 weeks was investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel clinical trial of 76 healthy adults. Before and during supplementation, gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded daily using a multi-symptom questionnaire. Clinical chemistry, hematology, plasma lipids, and intestinal permeability and inflammation markers were measured at baseline and end of study. Compared to placebo, 2 × 109 colony-forming units (CFU) BS50 per day increased the proportion of participants showing improvement from baseline to week 6 in the composite score for bloating, burping, and flatulence (47.4% vs. 22.2%), whereby the odds of detecting an improvement were higher with BS50 (OR [95% CI]: 3.2 [1.1, 8.7], p = .024). Analyses of individual gastrointestinal symptoms indicate that BS50 increased the proportion of participants showing an improvement at week 6 compared to placebo for burping (44.7% vs. 22.2%, p = .041) and bloating (31.6% vs. 13.9%, p = .071), without affecting other symptoms. There were no clinically meaningful changes in clinical chemistry, hematology, plasma lipids and intestinal permeability and other inflammation markers. In conclusion, the results suggest that dietary supplementation of 2 × 109 CFU Bacillus subtilis BS50 per day is a well-tolerated and safe strategy to alleviate gas-related gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy adults.

METHODS: Adult IBS patients were enrolled in an open-label, randomized crossover trial (for nonresponders) with 1 year of follow-up using the web application IBS Constant Care (IBS CC). Patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic at the Department of Gastroenterology, North Zealand University Hospital, Denmark. Patients received either VSL#3 for 4 weeks (2 × 450 billion colony-forming units per day) or were placed on an LFD for 4 weeks. Patients responding to the LFD were reintroduced to foods high in FODMAPs, and probiotic responders received treatments whenever they experienced a flare-up of symptoms. Treatment response and symptom flare-ups were defined as a reduction or increase, respectively, of at least 50 points on the IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS). Web-based ward rounds were performed daily by the study investigator. Fecal microbiota were analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing (at least 10 million 2 × 100 bp paired-end sequencing reads per sample). RESULTS: A total of 34 IBS patients without comorbidities and 6 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Taken from participating subjects, 180 fecal samples were analyzed for their microbiota composition. Out of 21 IBS patients, 12 (57%) responded to the LFD and 8 (38%) completed the reintroduction of FODMAPs. Out of 21 patients, 13 (62%) responded to their first treatment of VSL#3 and 7 (33%) responded to multiple VSL#3 treatments. A median of 3 (IQR 2.25-3.75) probiotic treatments were needed for sustained symptom control. LFD responders were reintroduced to a median of 14.50 (IQR 7.25-21.75) high-FODMAP items. No significant difference in the median reduction of IBS-SSS for LFD versus probiotic responders was observed, where for LFD it was -126.50 (IQR -196.75 to -76.75) and for VSL#3 it was -130.00 (IQR -211.00 to -70.50; P>.99). Responses to either of the two treatments were not able to be predicted using patients' microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: The web-based LFD intervention and probiotic treatment were equally efficacious in managing IBS symptoms. The response to treatments could not be explained by the composition of the microbiota. The IBS CC web application was shown to be practical, safe, and useful for clinical decision making in the long-term management of IBS. Although this study was underpowered, findings from this study warrant further research in a larger sample of patients with IBS to confirm these long-term outcomes.

Functional imaging of IBS patients has revealed several abnormalities in various brain regions, such as significant activation of amygdala, thinning of insular and anterior cingulate cortex, and increase in hypothalamic gray matter, which results in poor psychiatric and cognitive outcomes. Interrelations between the enteric and central events in IBS-related gastrointestinal, neurological, and psychiatric pathologies have compelled researchers to study the gut-brain axis-a bidirectional communication that maintains the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal and central nervous system with gut microbiota as the protagonist. Thus, it can be disrupted by any alteration owing to the gut dysbiosis or loss of diversity in microbial composition. Available evidence indicates that the use of probiotics as a part of a balanced diet is effective in the management of IBS and IBS-associated neurodegenerative and psychiatric comorbidities.

We aimed to comprehensively (i) identify diet-microbiota associations in adults with IBS consuming habitual diet; (ii) assess the impact of two nutritional interventions on the microbiota; and (iii) determine whether baseline microbiota can predict clinical response to diet or probiotic intervention. METHODS: Data were analyzed from 95 individuals with IBS participating in a previously published 4-week 2x2 factorial design randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of the low FODMAP diet (LFD) and co-administration of a probiotic. Diet was assessed at four hierarchical levels and partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to profile the microbiota. RESULTS: There were numerous diet-microbiota associations especially at the nutrient level, including a negative association between protein and Bifidobacterium abundance (rs = -0.358, p < 0.001). After correction for multiple testing, the significance for this association (q = 0.237) and all others was lost. Low FODMAP diet led to changes in abundance of major saccharolytic genera compared with sham diet, including higher Bacteroides (LFD 34.1% (15.7%) vs sham 23.3% (15.2%), q = 0.01) and lower Bifidobacterium (0.9% (1.0%) vs 2.1%, (2.5%) q = 0.029).

Primary endpoints included changes in symptom severity and improvement assessed with the IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) and Global Improvement Scale (IBS-GIS). The probiotic in comparison with placebo significantly improved the IBS symptom severity (the change of total IBS-SSS score from baseline ‒165.8 ± 78.9 in the probiotic group and ‒105.6 ± 60.2 in the placebo group, p = 0.005) and in the specific scores related to the severity of pain (p = 0.015) and the quality of life (p = 0.016) after eight weeks of intervention. The probiotic group indicated an improvement in symptoms with the use of the IBS-GIS compared with the placebo group after four (p = 0.04) and eight weeks (p = 0.003). The occurrence of adverse events did not differ between study groups. In conclusion, the multi-strain probiotic intervention resulted in a significant improvement in IBS symptoms evaluated with the use of both IBS-SSS and IBS-GIS scales.
