However, current guidelines lack specific antithrombotic recommendations for this population. This study aimed to explore the association between rivaroxaban and the prognosis of patients with AMI and new-onset AF.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This retrospective cohort study included patients with AMI and new-onset AF receiving dual antiplatelet therapy between August 2016 and June 2023 in Tianjin, China. New-onset AF (transient or nontransient) was defined as the first diagnosis of AF following AMI. The primary outcome was stroke.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">2477 patients were identified, including 141 rivaroxaban users and 2336 patients without oral anticoagulants (OAC). Over a median follow-up of 922 days, rivaroxaban users had a 5.7% lower risk of stroke than non-OAC users, although this was not statistically significant (19.9% vs. 25.6%; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.152). Despite the suggestion of a protective trend, multivariable Cox regression showed that rivaroxaban use was not associated with a lower risk of stroke (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-1.13, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.187). After propensity score matching, 155 transient (rivaroxaban: 42; non-OAC: 113) and 295 nontransient AF patients (rivaroxaban: 85; non-OAC: 210) were included. No significant association was observed between rivaroxaban and stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, bleeding, or major bleeding.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">No significant association was observed between rivaroxaban and clinical outcomes in patients with AMI and new-onset AF. Given the small sample size and limited statistical power, the findings are exploratory and require further validation. Key messages &#x2002;What is already known on this topic: Evidence from previous studies indicates that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) are associated with higher risks of ischemic stroke and mortality. However, the association between rivaroxaban and the prognosis of patients with AMI and new-onset AF remains uncertain. &#x2002;What this study adds: Among patients with AMI and new-onset AF receiving dual antiplatelet therapy, no significant differences were observed between rivaroxaban users and non-oral anticoagulant users in terms of the risks of stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, bleeding, or major bleeding. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size and limited statistical power of the study. &#x2002;How this study might affect research, practice or policy: Future prospective large-scale studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to further examine the role of rivaroxaban and other types of oral anticoagulants in patients with AMI and new-onset AF.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#xa9; The Author(s) 2025.
