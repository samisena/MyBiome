Persons aged 25 to 84 years with a diagnosis record of T1DM with prescription of insulin from January 2005 to December 2016 were included if they had baseline low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) &#x2265;2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol &#x2265;3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). Persons with preexisting coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, myopathy, liver disease, rheumatic heart disease, schizophrenia or cancer were excluded. Main outcome measures were all-cause mortality, major CVD and adverse events (myopathy and liver dysfunction). We estimated 10-year absolute risk differences (RDs) for the observational analogues of the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) effects.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">We included 4,176 statin initiator (mean age of 45 years, 33.1% &lt;40 years, 40.6% female) and 16,704 noninitiator person-trials with median follow-up of 6 years. Compared with noninitiation, statins were associated with reductions in all-cause mortality (RD<sub>ITT</sub>: -1.66% [95% CI: -2.79% to -0.45%]; RD<sub>PP</sub>: -3.48% [95% CI: -4.68% to -2.07%]) and major CVD (RD<sub>ITT</sub>: -1.63% [95% CI: -2.57% to -0.53%]; RD<sub>PP</sub>: -2.69% [95% CI: -4.00% to -1.22%]). Some analyses suggested a slight association with increased risk of liver dysfunction but no association with myopathy. In subgroup analyses, absolute risk reductions were generally larger in women, persons &#x2265;40 years of age, persons with baseline LDL-C &#x2265;3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL), and persons with a higher predicted cardiovascular risk.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Among adults with T1DM, statin initiation for primary prevention was associated with reductions in all-cause mortality and major CVD with a very low risk of adverse effects. The differences in absolute risk reductions can help guide personalized statin treatment decisions in T1DM.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#xa9; 2025 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
