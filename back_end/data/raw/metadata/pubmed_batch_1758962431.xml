However, the time (early or extended window) of the stroke may also influence the identification of prognostically relevant regions. We aim to determine whether topological information captured by CT ASPECTS contributes prognostic value in different time windows.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A post-hoc analysis of the DEVT and RESCUE BT studies was conducted. Pretreatment ASPECTS was evaluated by Fast-Processing of Ischemic Stroke software. Patients who had infarcts in at least one ASPECTS region (ASPECTS &#x2264; 9) were included and categorized according to treatment time window (early, 0-6&#xa0;hours versus extended, 6-24&#xa0;hours from last known well to puncture). The primary outcome measure was poor clinical prognosis (90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between lesion topography and prognosis after endovascular treatment at each time window.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 1040 patients (mean age 68&#xa0;years, 58.7% male) were included in this cohort analysis, with 564 in the early (265 with good prognosis versus 299 with poor prognosis) and 476 in the extended (218 with good prognosis versus 258 with poor prognosis) time window. For the early time window strokes, involvement of insula (OR: 1.636, 95% CI: 1.130 to 2.367), caudate nucleus (OR: 1.730, 95% CI: 1.012 to 2.957), and the M6 (OR: 1.773, 95% CI: 1.041 to 3.022) were independent factors associated with the poor prognosis at 90&#xa0;days after adjusted by age, hypertension, diabetes, baseline NIHSS, and the time from onset to puncture. In the extended window, the M3 (OR: 2.153, 95% CI: 1.110 to 4.175), the M5 (OR: 1.775, 95% CI: 1.190 to 2.649) were independent prognostic factors.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Different infarct regions have varying predictive power for poor outcomes in large vessel occlusion stroke patients with different time windows. This outcome may help to identify treatment-eligible patients who are in greatest need of rapid reperfusion treatment.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).
