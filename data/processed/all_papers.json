    "title": "Lactobacillus acidophilus ameliorates obesity in mice through modulation of gut microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal permeability.",
    "abstract": "Obesity associated with low-grade chronic inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis is considered as a worldwide public health crisis. In the meanwhile, different probiotics have demonstrated beneficial effects on this condition, thus increasing the interest in the development of probiotic treatments. In this context, the aim of this study is to investigate the anti-obesity effects of potential probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus isolated from the porcine gut. Then, it is found that L. acidophilus reduces body weight, fat mass, inflammation and insulin resistance in mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD), accompanied by activation in brown adipose tissue (BAT) as well as improvements of energy, glucose and lipid metabolism. Besides, our data indicate that L. acidophilus not only reverses HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, as indicated by the decreased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratios and endotoxin bearing Gram-negative bacteria levels, but also maintains intestinal barrier integrity, reduces metabolic endotoxemia, and inhibits the TLR4 / NF- κB signaling pathway. In addition, the results of microbiome phenotype prediction by BugBase and bacterial functional potential prediction using PICRUSt show that L. acidophilus treatment improves the gut microbiota functions involving metabolism, immune response, and pathopoiesia. Furthermore, the anti-obesity effect is transmissible via horizontal faeces transfer from L. acidophilus-treated mice to HFD-fed mice. According to our data, it is seen that L. acidophilus could be a good candidate for probiotic of ameliorating obesity and associated diseases such as hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, and insulin resistance through its anti-inflammatory properties and alleviation of endothelial dysfunction and gut dysbiosis.",
