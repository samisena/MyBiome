# Phase 3 Progress Update

**Date**: October 6, 2025
**Status**: Database migration complete ✅ | Integration approach needs adjustment ⚠️

---

## What's Been Accomplished ✅

### 1. Database Migration - COMPLETE ✅

**Script Created**: [`add_semantic_normalization_tables.py`](back_end/src/migrations/add_semantic_normalization_tables.py)

**Tables Created** (verified in intervention_research.db):
- ✅ `semantic_hierarchy` (0 rows - ready for population)
- ✅ `entity_relationships` (0 rows - ready for population)
- ✅ `canonical_groups` (0 rows - ready for population)

**Views Created**:
- ✅ `v_intervention_hierarchy`
- ✅ `v_intervention_by_canonical`
- ✅ `v_intervention_by_variant`

**Old Tables Preserved** (for comparison):
- `canonical_entities` (191 rows)
- `entity_mappings` (389 rows)

**Migration Output**:
```
================================================================================
MIGRATION COMPLETE
================================================================================

New tables created:
  - semantic_hierarchy (4-layer hierarchical structure)
  - entity_relationships (pairwise relationship tracking)
  - canonical_groups (Layer 1 aggregation entities)

Views created:
  - v_intervention_hierarchy
  - v_intervention_by_canonical
  - v_intervention_by_variant

[WARNING]  Old tables still exist:
  - canonical_entities (191 rows)
  - entity_mappings (389 rows)

Run with --drop-old to remove them (after verifying migration)
```

## Discovery: Integration Approach Needs Adjustment ⚠️

### Issue Identified

The existing `normalizer.py` (MainNormalizer class) was designed for the experimental setup:
- Expects **two separate databases** (source + target)
- Target database is `hierarchical_normalization.db` (experimental)
- Uses hardcoded paths from experiments folder

**Current architecture**:
```
Source DB: intervention_research.db (interventions table)
Target DB: hierarchical_normalization.db (semantic_hierarchy tables)
          [separate experimental database]
```

**Desired architecture**:
```
Single DB: intervention_research.db
           ├── interventions (existing)
           ├── semantic_hierarchy (NEW ✅)
           ├── entity_relationships (NEW ✅)
           └── canonical_groups (NEW ✅)
```

## Solution Options

### Option A: Adapt Existing Normalizer ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Modify `normalizer.py` to work with single database**

**Changes needed**:
1. Change `MainNormalizer.__init__` to accept single db_path
2. Update HierarchyManager to use main database
3. Update cache paths to use new config.py paths
4. Test with diabetes condition

**Pros**:
- Uses proven code from experiments
- All caching logic already works
- Embedding and LLM components tested

**Cons**:
- Requires modifying existing code
- Need to update imports

**Estimated time**: 1-2 hours

---

### Option B: Create New Orchestrator from Scratch
**Build simpler orchestrator that directly populates semantic_hierarchy**

**What I created**: `rotation_semantic_normalizer.py`
- Loads interventions from DB
- Calls normalizer methods
- Populates semantic_hierarchy

**Problem**: Assumes `normalize_interventions()` method exists
- Actual normalizer has different interface
- Designed for two-database setup

**Pros**:
- Clean separation from experiments
- Tailored for production pipeline

**Cons**:
- Need to reimplement caching logic
- Need to reimplement embedding/LLM calls
- More time to build and test

**Estimated time**: 3-4 hours

---

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Quick Win) ⚡ FASTEST
**Use normalizer as-is, just point target_db to main database**

**Steps**:
1. Keep `Main Normalizer` unchanged
2. Pass `intervention_research.db` as BOTH source and target
3. Test if it works (tables already exist there)

**Pros**:
- Zero code changes
- Immediate testing possible
- Uses all existing logic

**Cons**:
- Not ideal architecture (expects two DBs)
- May have conflicts if tables already exist

**Estimated time**: 15 minutes to test

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Option C - Quick Test)
```bash
cd back_end/experiments/semantic_normalization

# Test if normalizer works with single DB
python -c "
from main_normalizer import MainNormalizer

normalizer = MainNormalizer(
    source_db_path='../../data/processed/intervention_research.db',
    target_db_path='../../data/processed/intervention_research.db'  # Same DB!
)

# Test on small subset
# normalizer.normalize_all_interventions(limit=50)
"
```

### Short-term (Option A - Adapt Normalizer)
1. Copy normalizer.py to src/semantic_normalization/
2. Update to single-database architecture
3. Update imports to use new config
4. Test thoroughly

### Medium-term (Integration)
1. Once normalizer works, integrate into batch_medical_rotation.py
2. Add as Phase 3 (after categorization)
3. Update data mining to use new schema

## Current Status by Task

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Database Migration** | ✅ COMPLETE | Tables created and verified |
| **Normalization Orchestrator** | ⚠️ NEEDS ADAPTATION | Interface mismatch discovered |
| **Testing on Diabetes** | ⏳ BLOCKED | Waiting for orchestrator fix |
| **Pipeline Integration** | ⏳ PENDING | Blocked by testing |
| **Data Mining Updates** | ⏳ PENDING | Can start independently |
| **Documentation** | ⏳ PENDING | Waiting for completion |

---

## What Doesn't Require Ground Truth (Good News!)

All of this work is **independent of labeling**:
- ✅ Database migration (done)
- ⏳ Normalizer adaptation (in progress)
- ⏳ Testing on real data (uses LLM, not labels)
- ⏳ Pipeline integration (orchestration only)
- ⏳ Data mining updates (query changes)

**Ground truth only needed for**:
- Evaluation (measuring accuracy)
- Threshold tuning (optional)

**You can continue labeling in parallel!**

---

## Time Estimates

**Quick Win Path** (Option C → Option A):
- Test with current normalizer: 15 min
- If it works: ~1 hour to clean up
- If it doesn't: Switch to Option A (~2 hours)

**Total remaining**: 2-3 hours to complete Phase 3

---

## Next Actions

**Me**:
1. Test Option C (quick win) - 15 min
2. If successful, document and proceed to integration
3. If not, implement Option A (adapt normalizer) - 2 hours

**You**:
- Continue labeling (completely independent)
- No blockers on your end

---

## Summary

**Progress**: 30% complete (1/3 major components)
- ✅ Database schema ready
- ⚠️ Orchestrator needs adjustment
- ⏳ Integration pending

**Blocker**: Architectural mismatch between experimental normalizer and production database

**Solution**: Multiple options available, testing quickest path now

**Timeline**: 2-3 hours remaining to complete Phase 3

**Your work**: Not blocked - continue labeling!

---

**Status**: Paused for architectural decision
**Next**: Test Option C (use normalizer with same source/target DB)
